# MeHelp
Now-a-days lots of elderly people especially those who suffer from eye sight problem experience difficulties when trying to call someone. This situation can be really serious if the person is in some sort of trouble and therefore needs immediate assistance. With traditional calling features sometimes, it is hard for elders to read the text to make a call. We want to address this problem seriously and prevent any unfortunate incidents from happening in future. Our aim is to ensure safety of our elderly people and offer them care just like they did for us when we needed it most by creating a mobile application that would help them to contact their next of kin or care giver easily with one touch.
